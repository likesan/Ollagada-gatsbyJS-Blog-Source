## Ah..

I dont know how much should I prepare with it.

We have to do it only minimum. but what's the meaning of minimum?

at Least we have to had ... or as long as we can stay, we have to ready as much as we can.

## what we need for it?

actually we need enough budget.

161 $ for arrival whether it's Chiangmai or Bangkok

then need to stay 1 month, 7000 baht. but they ask the deposit 2 months, so 14000 baht. that's almost... 21000 bath. 75 manwon.

and we need the equipments to record our journey.

1. Iphone 6s as 4k recoder
this one has price the 200$

2. Stabilizer as DJI Ozma or Zhiyun Smooth Q
each of them is pricing 150$ and 100$.

## but I am not sure this is right plan..
