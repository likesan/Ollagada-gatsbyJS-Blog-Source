# 일단 적어보는 글귀

사실 영어로 써야할지 말지 지금도 좀 혼란스럽다.
영어로 쓰면 영어가 연습될테니 좋긴하지만 뭐랄까 
어떤 말을 정확히 전달하고 싶은지 한글보다 전달력이 떨어질테니
조금 망설여지게 된다.
하지만
영어를 쓰는 것이 더 좋지 않을까
하지만 효율적인 소통을 위해서는 한글을 쓰는 것도 나쁘진 않을 것도 같은데...

음.. 내 마음이 원하는 쪽으로 써보자
한글보다는 영어로 이야기해보고 싶다.

# I wanna write through the English.

I dont know what Ill do today
there is the job for visiting the Samsungdong.
It's for an interview. I have a work during 2 days through the 13-14th.
12-13th?
not sure but, it's gonna be an Experience as well.
Because it's welcoming work for Golf Atheletes in Incheon Airport.
That will be interesting job.


# I wonder what is the key to make better my daily?

should I love myself?
should I make list what I love in this world?
I love this job. I meant, this writing.
While I write something there is no problem and only I can feel a focus.

I like that. there is nothing between world and me.
just I can feel peace and calm.
Beside, during the writing, I can get more calmness, and tranquility.
Even Some people argue a writing is like a meditation.
# **To do aware.**

## hm... What I love?

To see the world get going very well.
Such as recently, this country gets good vibe in unity with North Korea.
That's good news, that makes me feel love.

and when I have a good organized mind by writing well, that's good feeling as well.

and even this writing, I can find out what I love to do, It's a love as well.


# but sometimes that's not easy actually.

Rather I want to be lazy on everything, because I hate to be busy.
I dont want to be busy but just focused and well organized.
How can I do that?
**then this writing is hack skill to do!**

# I want to have more love with various girls.

hm.. I dont know. this sentence isn't right for me.
rather I want to be free from every desire.
that's quite burden.
I should care my body, healthiness... some people argue that's quite pleasure during a living but... for me I dont thing so.
Because our physical body, for living we have to care. Washing it, Exercising it for blood circumtance, finding what I love..
the last thing is only my favourite.

# To find what I love to do. that's the thing that I genuinely love.

but mostly what I like to do is...traveling. I dont know what's the exactly currect word to call the activity.
Walking and talking and watching how the people interact with each others. That's the thing what I really like to do!
because there is an history, culture, etc.

# sight-seeing is the thing that I really like.
in this world, I got only one chance to flow on this 'current moment' but during the time, I can be an observer.
through that observing.
I love to see how they act. just I like it :)


# hm.. what else?

well although this writing, I dont know what's right or good.
should I write about a subject?
perhaps it can be the.. Shinchon life.

# How was the Shinchon life?

actually that was really good. the first happy step was to meet this host. he always helped us up. How? He offered this room within just 420 bucks. It means, I just need to pay 210 bucs for a year. so 7 buck for a day! how cheap is that?!

# Writing a book

writing is good activity but I dont know one thing that what should I write down?
perhaps on the amazon?
that's gonna be a work.
but I like to write on Korean if I should make a book...
hm...
I dont know.


# but the first is what should I do ! Today!

such as tim ferris introduced through his book `Tribe of mentors`, I should see the impact-point.
So the today is the impact-point, then Next 5 mins as well.
What should I do for next 5mins?
WRiting, keep writing!
and buying a shirt to get ready to go the Samsungdong.
It takes 1 hour to arrive. Quite far.

# then.. Ill need to write down their information.
What should I prepare? Who they are? GPA?
Need to understand their word.
However, should I do like that? my mission is just deliver them to their matching place.

whatever, I dont need to care about them?
hm... I need to check them up for once.

hm.....
Daiso Shirt review
it looks not good so...
a brand shirt is good to me.

hm...


# What's the right thing?
I dont know..

Do what you love..

# How kwonwoo was grabbed by Oh 

what can I do?
well
아으...
사실 나도 잘 모르겠다.
그냥 책이나 보고 공부나 해야하는거 아닐까
중요하지 않고 기분좋지 않은 것들은 거부하면 되는거 아닐까
그리고 주어진 것들에 기분좋게 살아가면서 느끼면 되는거 아닐까
다만 좋아하는 것들을 해야겠지
좋아하는 것들
좋아하는 것들이라..

its up to me...
do good things for this world.
what can I give them?
if I met something good phrase then, I can present it through the instagram.

hm..
but what's the value that I can serve for people?


```
My experience?
My review?
My thought?
```

# How can they become a good resource for this world?

In honest way, I dont know..
or I don't like to make them much.
why?
I am not dilligent person?
nope. I am so dilligent but I just don't like them that much


hm.. why?
because it requires too many efforts....
ha... everything requires the efforts but what's the thing that effortless? nope, although there is an effort but if that's more pleasurable, it's working.

then what's my thing that pleasure for me?

watching this different countrie's history or something.
rather want to be a travel writer;

but there is nothing... that can be borned without any efforts.

# every creating needs the effort.

What's quite right answer?

I dont know..
I need to do what I really love to do...
what's the thing?
Do I still find that?
or I know some works with it :D

Coding is the thing but need to serve them on Website.
Need to check their needs...?


# Need to read the book...

오늘이 즐거워야 성공에 가까워진다.
Yeah Success is the ideal status. Happiness, Satisfying.


# MY dream..


# **How to make pleasure today?**
ah this is the key..

# Daily, making it better day and happy...

hm..
I know but....
everything is alright.
but.. uhm...

something... I want to find out that I really love..
that I really haunt thign..
what's that?

    hm..
